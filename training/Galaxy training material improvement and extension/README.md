## Background information
---
[Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org) is an open-source web framework for easy-to-use, reproducible and shareable computational life science research, with >100 public Galaxy servers. Training is an integral part of the Galaxy community. In collaboration with [GOBLET](https://www.mygoblet.org/) and the [ELIXIR Training Platform](https://www.elixir-europe.org/platforms/training), the [Galaxy Training Network](https://galaxyproject.org/teach/gtn/) is developing open, peer-reviewed and FAIR training material: >80 tutorials developed by >100 contributors, available at https://training.galaxyproject.org, to deliver training for scientists, developers and system administrators. The material is complemented by metadata to automatically populate the [ELIXIR training portal (TeSS)](https://tess.elixir-europe.org/) and to describe the technical infrastructure needed to run the tutorial (e.g. tools, data, workflows, etc.).

The project is aimed at making the contribution process as easy as possible, so that no specific knowledge or skills are required from contributors, and there are extensive [training materials about how to contribute to this project](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/contributing://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/contributing/)


## Expected outcomes
---

We have many ideas for this work and participants can work on a wide range of topics depending on their interests:

- **Content**
 - New topics, new tutorials
 - Review open pull requests
 - Check and improve existing tutorials
 - Training Handbook for instructors

- **Global Infrastructure**
 - FAIRness evaluation of the training
 - Plan internationalisation and localisation support in order to make the training material available to users in their own language
 - BioSchemas support
 - Complete integration iwth the TeSS workflow annotator

- **Technical support**
 - Workflow testing
 - Docker images
 - [Interactiver tours]()

- **Community**
 - More visibility for training events
 - Support for Instructors

## Expected audience
---

Instructors and anyone eager to develop Galaxy-related training material. No specific knowledge or skills are required, just motivation!

**Expected hacking days**: 4 days, 3 days, 2 days
